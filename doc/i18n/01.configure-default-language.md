# Configure the default language

I wanted the i18n to remain as _typesafe_ as possible while also being as easy to maintain as possible.  
Here, we will switch from _French_ to _English_ as the default language to provide a dead-simple example.

## The `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_OBJ` alias

You'll first have to edit the `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_OBJ` alias in [the _i18n config file_.](/interop/config/i18n.ts)

For example, if I want to use _English_ as my default language, instead of _French_:

```ts
// config/i18n.ts
import DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_OBJ from '@/i18n/locales/fr';
```

Would become:

```ts
// config/i18n.ts
import DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_OBJ from '@/i18n/locales/en'; // * ... fr -> en
```

## Adapting posts files

Don't forget to adapt the structure of your [_blog posts folder_.](/content/blog/)  
For instance, here, the 'en' folders should be renamed to 'fr', and you should swap the _English_ and _French_ files.

Happy coding! :)
