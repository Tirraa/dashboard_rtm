# Configure the default language

I wanted the i18n to remain as _typesafe_ as possible while also being as easy to maintain as possible.  
Here, we will switch from _French_ to _English_ as the default language to provide a dead-simple example.

## The first key from `ELanguagesFlag` is special

The first key from [the `ELanguagesFlag` enum](/src/config/i18n.ts) **defines** the default language.  
Also, to preserve the code consistency, it is preferable to keep the match with the language of `VocabBase`!

For example, if I want to use the _English_ as my default language:

```ts
// config/i18n.ts
export type VocabBase = typeof import('@/i18n/locales/fr').default;
export enum ELanguagesFlag {
  fr,
  en
}
```

Would become:

```ts
// config/i18n.ts
export type VocabBase = typeof import('@/i18n/locales/en').default; // * ... fr -> en
export enum ELanguagesFlag {
  en, // * ... en is now the first key of ELanguagesFlag!
  fr
}
```

If you are attentive, you may have noticed that we introduced an error in the code:

> Type alias 'VocabBase' circularly references itself. _ts (2456)_

This is because we need to do an adjustment in the locales files...

## Adapting locales files

### Just a recap before we start to edit the locales

Since we have modified '_VocabBase_', a minor adjustment to the two i18n files that we '_swapped_' here is necessary.  
First, let's open [`fr.ts`](/src/i18n/locales/fr.ts) and [`en.ts`](/src/i18n/locales/en.ts) and pay attention...

We see that the [`fr.ts`](/src/i18n/locales/fr.ts) file contains:

```ts
// locales/fr.ts
export default {
  navbar: {
    home: 'Accueil',
    dashboard: 'Dashboard'
    // * ...
  }
  // * ...
} as const;
```

Whereas, the [`en.ts`](/src/i18n/locales/en.ts) file contains:

```ts
// locales/en.ts
import { VocabType } from '@/types/i18n';

export default {
  navbar: {
    home: 'Homepage',
    dashboard: 'Dashboard'
    // * ...
  }
  // * ...
} satisfies VocabType; /* ...
Notice that we discreetly type the English vocab here, aligning it with the schema of the default language.
As `VocabBase` is now equal to `typeof import('@/i18n/locales/en')`, it does not make sense anymore!
Our 'Circularly reference' error is here.
*/
```

### Let's swap!

[`fr.ts`](/src/i18n/locales/fr.ts) would become:

```ts
// locales/fr.ts
import { VocabType } from '@/types/i18n';

export default {
  navbar: {
    home: 'Accueil',
    dashboard: 'Dashboard'
    // * ...
  }
  // * ...
} satisfies VocabType; /* ...
Notice that we now discreetly type the French vocab here, aligning it with the schema of the default language...
That we turned to English in this example!
Phew! Everything is back in order.
*/
```

And [`en.ts`](/src/i18n/locales/en.ts) would become:

```ts
// locales/en.ts
export default {
  navbar: {
    home: 'Homepage',
    dashboard: 'Dashboard'
    // * ...
  }
  // * ...
} as const;
```

## Adapting posts files

Don't forget to adjust the structure of your ['_posts_' folder.](/posts/)  
For instance, here, the 'en' folders should be renamed to 'fr', and you should swap the _English_ and _French_ files.

Happy coding! :)
