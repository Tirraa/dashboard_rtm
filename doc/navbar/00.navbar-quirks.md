# Navbar quirks

There are certain subtleties that you must know about the navbar in this codebase.

## Dropdowns are not rendered on mobile

Since dropdowns in the _Mobile_ version of a navbar are undesirable, they are disabled on mobile, reverting to regular buttons.  
In this scenario, their routes will be the ones defined in [SITEWIDE_NAVBAR_ROUTES](/src/config/SitewideNavbar/routesImpl.ts).  
It is up to you to adjust the pages served by those routes.

## Internal mechanics: `getComputedNavData` and `RoutesKeysUnion`

Since a navbar may also serve as a '_Mega menu_' in its _Desktop_ version, this one implements its own `DropdownsConfig`
([`NavbarDropdownsConfig`](/src/types/WebsiteUtils.ts)), depending on the [`getComputedNavData` function](/src/lib/misc/getComputedNavData.ts) which
also depends on a type representing the union of all the routes keys defined in this App code: [`RoutesKeysUnion`.](/src/types/RoutesKeysUnion.ts)

Please, maintain the [`RoutesKeysUnion`](/src/types/RoutesKeysUnion.ts) type when you define new routes, in order to maintain the genericity of
[`getComputedNavData`.](/src/lib/misc/getComputedNavData.ts)

Happy coding! :)
