# Pages testing documents

Let's explore the testing feature!

The basic implementation of the documents is rigorously tested. Nevertheless, it is possible to extend the fields of these documents, including the
computed ones. Hence, it is possible to create test documents so that you can continue to proceed with tests in a standard way.

## The Pages Config file

As I write these lines, the [_landing pages folder_](/content/pages/) looks like this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ another-root
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ nesting-2
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page-00.mdx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page-01.mdx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page-00.mdx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page-01.mdx
â””â”€â”€ testing-pages-root
    â”œâ”€â”€ fake-draft-00.mdx
    â”œâ”€â”€ fake-nesting
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.mdx
    â””â”€â”€ fake-page-00.mdx
```

It is possible to change the testing root thanks to the [_page config file_.](/src/config/pages.ts)

Let:

```ts
// src/config/pages.ts
const TESTING_ROOT = 'testing-pages-root' as const satisfies PageRoot;
```

Become:

```ts
// src/config/pages.ts
const TESTING_ROOT = 'another-root' as const satisfies PageRoot;
```

And let's build again!  
Then, you will see that the number of automatically generated static pages will change.

If we go back with the `testing-pages-root` and build again...  
Then, you will see that the number of automatically generated static pages will change again.

## Testing

You will only be able to get those documents in the test environment.

It is recommended to use `getPageByLanguageAndPathStrict` to retrieve them so that you can trust the Intellisense.

Likewise:

```ts
// __tests__/whatever.test.ts
const root = PagesConfig.TESTING_ROOT;
const targettedPath = `${root}/fake-page-00` as const;
const language = DEFAULT_LANGUAGE;
const page = getPageByLanguageAndPathStrict({ lang: language, path: targettedPath }) as Page;
```
