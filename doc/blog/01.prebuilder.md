# How the internal _prebuilder_ helps you to build your blog better

A custom-built [internal _prebuilder_](/packages/prebuilder/) is provided to assist you in ensuring the safety of your code and offering errors-driven
maintenance processes.

It is called during the `prebuild` phase, via [the _package.json file_](/package.json):

```bash
# package.json
pnpm --filter @rtm/prebuilder start --blog-posts-folder ./content/blog --i18n-locales-schema ./src/i18n/locales/schema.ts
```

> Notice that the "." in the paths you provide to the env variables actually refers to the project root folder

It will autogenerate some code to keep the type safety of your [i18n schema file](/src/i18n/locales/schema.ts), and of the blog API.

Happy coding! :)
