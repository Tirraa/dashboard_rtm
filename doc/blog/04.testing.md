# Blog testing documents

Let's explore the testing feature!

The basic implementation of the documents is rigorously tested. Nevertheless, it is possible to extend the fields of these documents, including the
computed ones. Hence, it is possible to create test documents so that you can continue to proceed with tests in a standard way.

## The Blog Config file

As I write these lines, the [_blog folder_](/content/blog/) looks like this:

```
├── blog-testing-category
│   └── fake-subcategory
│       ├── drafts
│       │   ├── fake-draft-01.mdx
│       │   ├── fake-draft-02.mdx
│       │   └── fake-draft-03.mdx
│       ├── fake-post-01.mdx
│       ├── fake-post-02.mdx
│       ├── fake-post-03.mdx
│       ├── index.mdx
│       └── posts
│           ├── fake-post-01.mdx
│           ├── fake-post-02.mdx
│           ├── fake-post-03.mdx
│           ├── fake-post-04.mdx
│           └── index.mdx
└── another-existing-category
    └── ...
```

It is possible to change the testing category thanks to the [_blog config file_.](/src/config/blog.ts)

Let:

```ts
// src/config/blog.ts
const TESTING_CATEGORY = 'blog-testing-category' as const satisfies BlogCategory;
```

Become:

```ts
// src/config/blog.ts
const TESTING_CATEGORY = 'another-existing-category' as const satisfies BlogCategory;
```

And let's build again!  
Then, you will see that the number of automatically generated static pages will change.

If we go back with the `blog-testing-category` and build again...  
Then, you will see that the number of automatically generated static pages will change again.

## Testing

You will only be able to get those documents in the test environment.

It is recommended to use `getBlogPostStrict` to retrieve them so that you can trust the Intellisense.

Likewise:

```ts
// __tests__/whatever.test.ts
const post = (await getBlogPostStrict({ category, subcategory, lang, slug })) as BlogPostType;
```

Happy coding! :)
