# Blog drafts

Let's explore the drafts feature!

---

## The blog documents front-matter

Let's create a dummy blog document.

```markdown
---
title: Note
metadescription: Meta description
description: Description
date: 2019-08-14 21:00
---

Hello world!
```

By default, this document will not be a draft.

You can tweak it to enable the draft feature just like so:

```markdown
---
draft: true
title: Note
metadescription: Meta description
description: Description
date: 2019-08-14 21:00
---

Hello world!
```

Because of a weird Contentlayer bug, keep the `draft` field at the top of the document properties. Otherwise, it could break its parsing on Windows.

## The Blog Config file

It is possible to toggle the presence of drafts in the production thanks to the [_blog config file_.](/src/config/blog.ts)

Let:

```ts
// src/config/blog.ts
const BlogConfig: BlogConfigType = {
  // * ...
  ENABLE_DRAFTS_IN_PROD: false
  // * ...
} as const;
```

Become:

```ts
// src/config/blog.ts
const BlogConfig: BlogConfigType = {
  // * ...
  ENABLE_DRAFTS_IN_PROD: true
  // * ...
} as const;
```

Then, let's build again!  
You will see that more static pages will be generated automatically and that the drafts will be shown in the built app.

That's all!

Happy coding! :)
