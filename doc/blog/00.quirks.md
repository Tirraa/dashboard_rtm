# Blog quirks

There are certain subtleties that you must know about the blog in this codebase.

## The `BlogPostSchema` and `BlogPostType` types

There is a "weird" defined document type in [the _Contentlayer tweakers config file_](/interop/config/contentlayer/contentlayerConfigTweakers.ts),
which is named `BlogPostSchema`.  
It has an empty `filePathPattern` and no `computedFields`.

If you pay closer attention to `BlogPostSchema` in the `.contentlayer/generated/index.d.ts` file after invoking the `$ make build-contentlayer`
command, you should understand quickly what it is:

```ts
// .contentlayer/generated/index.d.ts

// * ... Just an example of what would be a blog post document's type
export type BlogPostExample = {
  description?: undefined | string;
  _raw: Local.RawDocumentData;
  metadescription: string;
  date: IsoDateTimeString;
  subcategory: string;
  type: 'BlogPostExample';
  language: string;
  category: string;
  draft: boolean;
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  _id: string;
  url: string;
  body: MDX;
};

// * ... The BlogPostSchema type, as it would be generated
export type BlogPostSchema = {
  description?: undefined | string;
  _raw: Local.RawDocumentData;
  metadescription: string;
  date: IsoDateTimeString;
  type: 'BlogPostSchema';
  subcategory: string;
  category: string;
  language: string;
  draft: boolean;
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  _id: string;
  url: string;
  body: MDX;
};
```

The purpose of this "Schema" is to craft the _`BlogPostType` type_.  
To create a "Base" post type that dynamically rules all the others, and will allow us to proceed with a _generic_ approach.

Notice that _Contentlayer_ generates a _phantom type_, which is the `type` field.  
This field ensures that you cannot "Confuse" one type of document with another one.  
But, by dynamically creating the `BlogPostSchema`, coupled to all its related documents, then you can `Omit` this `type` field, and gain all the
advantages of the [_`BlogPostType` type_.](/src/types/Blog.ts)

```ts
// types/Blog.ts
import type { BlogPostSchema } from 'contentlayer/generated';

type ContentlayerPhantomType = 'type';
export type BlogPostType = Omit<BlogPostSchema, ContentlayerPhantomType>;
```
